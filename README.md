# 2048 Game
Welcome to the 2048 Game with MongoDB Integration! This project enhances the classic 2048 game by increasing load capacity and adding features such as "undo move" and "video replay" through the integration of MongoDB. The client is built with TypeScript and React, and the backend is powered by ExpressJS.
